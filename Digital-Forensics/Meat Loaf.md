# Solution
This one stumped me initally, and from the looks of it many others did too (as of writing 490 people have solved it)

I initally thought that it could be a cipher of some sorts. Looking at it further I thought that it could have been a form of esoteric programming language,as I had done a little bit of research on the topic when I was younger.

I started by looking at the esolang wiki, looking into any eso languages which mentioned themes of recipes,cooking,baking and finally chefs. This recipe (lets be real its a wall of text) given by Ekse is written in a esolang called chef.

Because im lazy I didnt bother trying to decipher it myself and I just put it into an online decipher. The following is what is outputted when the esolang is decoded:



Properly understanding esolangs is not a worthwhile skill to invest in. These types of programming languages tend to be developed as passion projects or just for fun. Sweaty Russian threat actors are not investing into developing an understanding of esolangs. Esolangs are only really used by enthusiasts and teenagers trying to share malware code on discord.
